## What is tested (measured 2026-10-24, box, `cargo test --release` + `make e2e`)
* Test counts are not written here (they went stale): `scripts/verify-and-push.sh` and CI run the whole
  workspace test suite and `scripts/e2e-local.sh`, and every push must be green.
* Known-answer vectors: BIP39/BIP32 "abandon…about" root; BIP44/49/84/86 BTC;
  ETH (EIP-55); LTC, DOGE, Tron (indices 0/1 and xpub parity TDTk…), XRP (incl.
  ACCOUNT_ZERO), Solana (SLIP-10 and ed25519 key 1); private key 1 in every
  encoding; Electrum standard/segwit seeds from Electrum's own test suite; base58
  edge cases; EIP-55 token addresses; Tron hex conversion and rejects.
  Non-standard goldens were cross-checked with an independent Python implementation
  (`scripts/kat.py`), not only against our own code.
* Boundary: every e2e pipeline runs through `sealed-run agent` and is grepped for
  secret-shaped strings (`LEAK` regex); secret fields must appear as `[REDACTED]`.
* Fixtures are self-made, throwaway, generated at test time; no real wallet or key
  has been used. A secret scanner runs before every push.

## What is NOT tested / known limits
* Not externally reviewed; no fuzzing yet, no formal review of the parsers against hostile files
  beyond size bounds and unit tests.
* Docker image verification on real hardware is done per release step only.
* Terminal confirmation is NOT proof of a human: any process that can spawn a pty can type the
  code (see "Terminal confirmation: residual risk" below). Terminal pinning narrows it; it doesn't close it.
* Signing / broadcasting tools are tested only against fixtures and a mock server.
* Old git history (commit 360a78e) contains throwaway test wallet files (public
  phrases, no value); history is deliberately not rewritten.

## Reporting issues
Report vulnerabilities privately to the maintainer via a GitHub security advisory
on the repository (Security → Report a vulnerability), not in a public issue. Do not
include real keys, seeds or wallet files in any report.

## Legacy-input amount proof

**Legacy-input amount proof (security review 2026-10-25).** A legacy (pre-segwit) sighash does not commit to the
amount being spent, so a host that lies about an input's value can make a signer pay a hidden fee (the classic
P2PKH fee attack). Rule, applied to every legacy-sighash family (BTC/LTC/DOGE/BLK/... P2PKH, GRS, PoS-nTime):
an input whose script is not a witness program must carry its full previous transaction. Bare P2SH counts as legacy (it may wrap any legacy script) unless the utxo line / PSBT carries a `redeem_script` that is a witness program hashing to the address (wrapped segwit, BIP143); tx-sign also accepts P2SH it can prove as its own key's P2SH-P2WPKH.
`utxo-fetch` adds `prev_tx` (raw hex) for such inputs; `tx-build` refuses without it (`legacy_input_needs_prev_tx`)
or when its txid (chain digest: GRS single SHA-256) or output disagrees with the claimed amount/script; the PSBT gets
`non_witness_utxo`, PoS envelopes get `pos_prevouts[i].prev_tx`. `tx-decode` reports `unproven_inputs`; `tx-verify`
fails with `legacy_input_amount_unproven` (not waivable by `--allow-warnings`); `tx-sign` refuses to sign such an
input. **BCH/BSV/BTG are not exempt:** their fork-id sighash commits to the amount (a lying amount would only
give an invalid signature), but every check keys on the script type and the fork-id signer (`sign_psbt_forkid`)
requires the proving previous tx too, so a P2PKH input on these chains needs `prev_tx` exactly like BTC P2PKH (test `forkid_needs_prev_tx`;
same rule for tx-build, `buildUnsignedSweep` in wasm, tx-decode/tx-verify and tx-sign). Only Zcash, whose
transactions are not PSBTs and carry amounts in the `zec_prevouts` envelope committed by ZIP-243/244, is exempt.

## Terminal confirmation: residual risk (security review 2026-10-25)

Earlier docs said "agent shells have no TTY". That is false: any process that can fork a pseudo-terminal
(Python `pty.fork`, `script`, `expect`, tmux) gets a controlling terminal, reads the code from it and
types it back. scripts/e2e-only/tty-drive.py does exactly that, and e2e uses it to drive `reveal`,
`sealed-run human` and `tx-sign`. The typed code proves that *something* answered on a terminal, not
that a human read the summary.

Partial mitigation: **terminal pinning.** The human runs `sealed-run pin-tty` once in their own terminal.
It records that terminal's session id and controlling-tty device in `~/.config/blocktools/tty-pin`
(from the password database, not `$HOME`; mode 0600). `$BLOCKTOOLS_TTY_PIN` can add a second pin but
can't remove one. While a pin exists, every confirmation (`tx-sign`, `tx-broadcast`, `acct-tx`, `xrp-tx`,
`xmr-wallet`, `sealed-run human`) refuses from any other session with `tty_session_not_pinned`. An unreadable pin
fails closed. e2e checks that a pin made in one pty refuses a code from a freshly spawned pty.

What it does NOT stop:
* an agent running as the same Unix user can delete or rewrite the pin (or pin its own pty first);
* injection into the pinned terminal itself (TIOCSTI where the kernel allows it, ptrace,
  `tmux send-keys`, terminal-emulator automation);
* platforms without /proc (macOS): there the session can't be read, so any pin fails closed and
  confirmation is refused while a pin exists.

It only helps when the agent runs as a different user (or in a container) that can't write the pin.
The real control is still the human reading the summary on a terminal the agent does not drive.

## Keystore KDF bounds (security review 2026-10-25)

`keystore-open` used per-knob caps (p ≤ 4) that rejected the Web3 spec's own scrypt vector (p=8). It now
bounds what matters: memory 128·N·r ≤ 256 MiB and work N·r·p ≤ 2^24 (8x geth standard), checked with
overflow-safe arithmetic before any allocation. All scrypt goes through the RustCrypto `scrypt` crate (>= 0.12, which dropped the RFC 7914
N < 2^(16r) erratum check, so the spec vector N=2^18, r=1 works); there is no in-tree KDF or cipher code.
Tests: spec vector (p=8),
geth --lightkdf (N=4096, r=8, p=6), RFC 7914 vector 2 through the crate, bounds, hostile 8 GiB request refused.

## EVM verification defaults (security review 2026-10-25)

`tx-verify` (and wasm `verifyTx` with `max_fee` "") now applies tx-sign's default EVM total-fee cap, gas × maxFeePerGas
≤ 0.01 ETH, so verify and sign agree; pass `--max-fee WEI` to change it. A nonzero native value alongside ERC-20
`transfer` calldata (the ETH would go to the token contract) fails with `eth_value_with_token_call` in tx-verify
and tx-sign unless `--allow-value-with-token`. Test: `evm_value_with_token_and_default_cap` (crates/tx/tests/kat.rs).

## Redactor and classify hardening (security review 2026-10-25)

`redact` (blocktools_schema::looks_secret / redact_line) now also refuses lines containing an XRP family seed
(`s` + 28-31 base58), a Bitcoin mini private key (`S` + 21/25/29 base58), or a 32-44 char base58 value in any
address-type field (`address`, `from`, `to`, `token`, `token_to`) unless the line says `"chain":"sol"`; a 32-byte
base58 value in any other string field is refused outright. `classify` on a password file (`/secrets/pw`, `pw*`,
`*pass*`) and on any `unknown` row prints class and line only: no SHA-256 fingerprint, which would be a
dictionary oracle for a low-entropy password. Tests: `rejects_xrp_seed_minikey_sol_secret`, classify `pw_paths`.

## Repo hygiene (security review 2026-10-25)

GitHub Actions are pinned by commit SHA; release publishing is a separate job in the `release` environment
(add required reviewers in repo Settings -> Environments for the manual approval to bite). `check-deps.sh`
runs with `LC_ALL=C` and reads members from `cargo metadata --locked`. The 28 Python wheels (23.8 MB) once (unmeasured)
committed at the repo root are removed going forward and `*.whl` is ignored; they remain in git history
(no rewrite). `scripts/hygiene-check.sh` (gate and CI) fails on unpinned actions or tracked build artifacts.

## Docs-versus-code checks and portable e2e (security review 2026-10-25)

`scripts/docs-check.sh` (gate and CI) fails if a tool under `tools/` is undocumented, a built tool is called
"planned", a hand-written test count appears in README/DESIGN/SECURITY, a host-side network tool
(rpc, utxo-fetch, tx-broadcast, xmr-wallet) is in crates/io/sealed-tools.txt (the sealed-run allowlist and the image ship list), or in-tree scrypt
reappears undisclosed. `scripts/e2e-local.sh` is part of the Linux gate; macOS (untested) is run by the macos CI job: `scripts/e2e-only/portable.sh`
replaces `setsid` (Python `os.setsid` fallback) and `stat -c` (BSD `stat -f`); checks whose fixtures need
the Python `cryptography` module (dat-read, recover, bitcoinj) print `skip ... pip install cryptography`
instead of failing. Each e2e.d script now runs in its own subshell, so one script's skip no longer ends the suite.

### EVM network pinning (review B, 2026-10-25)
For every EVM transaction, `tx-verify`, `tx-sign` and wasm `verifyTx` fail with `chain_id_not_pinned`
unless the caller passes `--chain-id` (`chain_id`), and with `chain_id_mismatch` when it differs from the
transaction's id. The network (e.g. BNB Smart Chain = 56) is a machine check, not left to the human.
The summary starts with a boxed `CHECK THESE` block: chain id and name, NATIVE vs TOKEN, final recipient,
value and max fee in the chain's native symbol (ETH, BNB, POL, AVAX), with a marker when native coin is
sent to a token contract.

### Script strictness (review F, 2026-10-25)
Every script in scripts/, scripts/e2e.d/ and recipes/ runs with `set -eu`; the check scripts and
recipes/recover.sh add `pipefail`. e2e-local.sh deliberately does not: its checks assert on a tool's
output (`tool | grep -q EXPECTED`), where the tool's nonzero exit is the refusal under test. grep
"no match" is tolerated only as exit 1 (`|| [ $? -eq 1 ]`), so grep errors stay fatal. Any
remaining `|| true` / `|| :` must carry an `# allow-true: reason` comment on the same line;
scripts/hygiene-check.sh fails otherwise. The audit found two real swallowed errors: secret-scan's
`xargs grep 2>/dev/null || true` (now `git grep`, fatal on error) and an e2e tx-broadcast no-tty
check whose result was discarded (its stdin was also overridden; now asserted).

### Explicit staging (review G, 2026-10-25)
Nothing stages with `git add -A`. Changes are staged by path; scripts/verify-and-push.sh never
stages and runs scripts/prepush-check.sh before testing and again before committing. It fails on
untracked non-ignored files, unstaged edits to tracked files, any tracked binary, and any tracked
file over 2 MB. CI runs it too. Local hook: `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` (.githooks/pre-push).
